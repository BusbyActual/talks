# Notes

## Intro (17 - 20s)

   Hello everyone I'm Ryan Busby.
   Today we're I'll be talking about **hacking**.
   When something breaks I get curious.
   So upon reading headlines about people being hacked I wanted to understand || something breaking
     A. How it happened
     B. What that looked like technically speaking


## What is a hacker expectations vs reality

   Often the media will display images like this: (GIF Slide)
   In reality they're often not wearing ski masks or gloves like a burglar

   Theres 3 main types of hackers

   - You have your white hat which is often a licensed consultant or auditor  aka ethical hacker
   - A grey hat is someone who will break the law unethecially but not maliciously
   - A black hat is an unethical and malicious hacker


## Specific vulnerability backstory

   (Too weighted at the beggining 40 - 45)
   Sid Myer's Civilization is a game where you play as a world leader. There are diplomacy, military and social policies and actions. In Civ there's a character for Mahatma Ghandi.

   Here's a few actions: (slide)

   On playing CIV I used diplimacy action that lowers the threat of an enemy with Ghandi and thought everything was peachy.

   The next turn Ghandi has unallied me, declared war, and started to research nukes all in one swoop.
   What gives? Ghandi is a man of peace.

   A few turns later her fires a nuke at one of my cities then casually asks for peace and to be allies.
   Somethings not right.

## Buffer overflow

   In CIV threat is assigned a value between 0 - 255.
   In reflection of Ghandis peacefullness his value is 1.

   What happens when you subtract 2 from threat? From say a diplomacy action...

   It doesn't go to -1 in a buffer overflow it will loop to the max value in this case 255

   Causing the most agression possible.

   Further more attacking him at 255 increases his agression so it overflows to a low number.
